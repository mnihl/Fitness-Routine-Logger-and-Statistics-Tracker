User can create "days" where they input either the exercises they do everytime, or ones that they could possibly do on that day. 
They can configure what variables are measured on the day, sets, reps, rest time, time per rep, pause reps/other special variation 
to the exercise

Everytime user trains they select what day they are doing, and begin to fill in a table, autofill suggestion is suggested for the 
exercise, and then whatever variable information they want to fill in is created and then they have to fill it in, once they 
"complete" the day it will show up to them in full, they can choose to compare stats with the previous day of the same type 
and get useful information showing improvements or just the increase/decrease comparison of the stats. 
This can be expanded to show more previous sessions, weekly/monthly/yearly stats. What you improved at the most/least etc. 
Just a bunch of interesting ways to display the stats. 

It suggests autofill for weights sets and reps ur doing once youve chosen the exercise based off previous sessions with it or maybe 
some algo/data from bmi or internet, however it will check ur past sessions and sometimes prompt/ask about increasing the weight if
 youve done the same for a lot of sessions.

start with making the logging sessions part so you can adapt the code to display it in various ways later and you can start loggin your
 workouts as example data right away
